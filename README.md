- 👋 Hi, I’m @SirLesP
- 👀 I’m interested in cheese, mainly proudly Australian cheese.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my first move with git and markdown.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me and others understand how to use git.
- 📫 How to reach me. I'm not quite sure yet, as I don't know how public this file will be or whether it will get scraped by people I'd not want scraping it...
